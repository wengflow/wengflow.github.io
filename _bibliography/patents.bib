    abstract = {An ambient sound environment is captured by a microphone array of an autonomous vehicle traveling in the ambient sound environment. A perception module of the autonomous vehicle classifies sounds and localizes sound sources in the ambient sound environment. Classification is performed using spectrum analysis and/or machine learning. In an embodiment, sound sources within a field of view (FOV) of an image sensor of the autonomous vehicle are localized in a visual scene generated by the perception module. In an embodiment, one or more sound sources outside the FOV of the image sensors are localized in a static digital map. Localization is performed using parametric or non-parametric techniques and/or machine learning. The output of the perception module is input into a planning module of the autonomous vehicle to plan a route or trajectory for the autonomous vehicle in the ambient sound environment.},
