# My Personal Website

This personal website is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio){:target="\_blank"} theme. It is statically generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="\_blank"} and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="\_blank"}. The `source` and `master` branch of this repository houses the source files and generated static content of this website respectively.

An [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com){:target="\_blank"} environment, with `ruby` and `clangxx_osx-64` packages installed, is used for development on macOS. It is important to ensure `ruby` is installed from the `conda-forge` channel to prevent gem native extension build errors. This happens at least on `ruby v2.5.1` from the default `anaconda` channel.
