Hi :wave:! I'm from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:.

I recently graduated with a PhD :mortar_board: under the supervision of [Associate Professor Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/) at the [Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://ids.nus.edu.sg). I previously obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) in Computer Engineering also from NUS in 2020.

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, with a particular focus on **3D scene representation, reconstruction and localization**.

**I am currently in the job market** :mag_right:. Do reach out if you have any opportunities that you think I might be a good fit for!
