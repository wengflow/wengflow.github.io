Hi :wave:! I'm from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:. I'm currently a Ph.D. student working under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/) at the [Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore](http://ids.nus.edu.sg). I obtained my B.Eng. (Hons.) degree :mortar_board: in Computer Engineering from National University of Singapore in 2020.

In general, I'm interested in the research and development of **intelligent robots** :robot:. I firmly believe that their introduction will immensely improve the quality of our everyday lives, especially through the automation of mundane, repetitive and laborious tasks.

My current research focuses on the aspect of **perception**, particularly **vision** :eyes:. I hope to progress towards complete scene understanding, and ultimately human-level semantic understanding of the world :earth_asia:.

My areas of interest include **scene representation, reconstruction, localization & understanding**, as well as **3D computer vision** in general.
