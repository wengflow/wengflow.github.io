Hi :wave:! I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia :malaysia:. I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Data Science, National University of Singapore](http://ids.nus.edu.sg) and my supervisor is [Asst. Prof. Gim Hee Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/). I obtained my B.Eng. (Hons.) degree :mortar_board: in Computer Engineering from National University of Singapore in 2020.

In general, I am interested in the research and development of intelligent robots :robot:. I firmly believe that their introduction will immensely improve the quality of our everyday lives, especially through the automation of mundane, repetitive and laborious tasks.

My current research focuses on the aspect of perception, particularly vision :eyes:. I hope to progress towards complete scene understanding, and ultimately human-level semantic understanding of the real world :earth_asia:.

My areas of interest include 3D computer vision, embodied AI, efficient learning and active learning.
